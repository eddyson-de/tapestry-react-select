# tapestry-react-select [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddyson-de/tapestry-react-select.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eddyson-de/tapestry-react-select) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/eddyson-de/tapestry-react-select.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

# Notice
This library is obsolete. It was originally created because `react-select` did not provide a proper AMD module. This has been addressed in `react-select v1.0.0-rc.6`, so the regular distribution can now be used with Tapestry. 

## Usage


### `build.gradle`:
```groovy
repositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
  runtime 'de.eddyson:tapestry-react-select:0.2.7'
}

```

See https://github.com/eddyson-de/tapestry-react for integration of React and Tapestry.
